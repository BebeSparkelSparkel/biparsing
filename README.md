## Notable Quotes

"IMO it's a mistake (although not an infrequent one) to try and use an optic as a parser or a printer or whatever. It's like trying to light a fire by striking your lighter against a rock. The whole point of polymorphic profunctor optics is that they can adjust arbitrary profunctors, including natural representations of parsers and printers"
**masaeedu**

"I suspect a "clean" way to do this sort of thing will eventually reveal within a profunctor encoding, but I haven't put much time into it yet :)" **ChrisPenner*
